# Virtual CPU Emulator Documentation

## *Project Objective*

The goal of this project is to simulate a virtual CPU using Python. The emulator is designed to fetch, decode, and execute basic instructions like arithmetic operations, memory access, input/output, and control flow. This project will be implemented in phases over multiple weeks.

---

## *Week 1: Project Planning & Setup*

### *Objective:*  
Define the project scope and set up the development environment.

### *Tasks:*
- Outline the virtual CPU features:
  - Arithmetic operations (e.g., ADD, SUB).
  - Branching instructions.
  - Memory access.
  - Input/Output.
- Choose Python as the programming language.
- Set up version control using GitHub for collaboration.

## *Week 2: Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)*

### *Objective:*  
Design the instruction set for the virtual CPU.

### *ISA Design:*

Each instruction is 8 bits:

- **First 4 bits (opcode):** Operation code (e.g., 1 for LOAD, 2 for ADD).
- **Last 4 bits (operand):** Data or memory location the instruction operates on.

### *Sample Instructions (Decimal Input and Binary Output):*

- **1 (LOAD):** Load immediate value 5 into Register R0.  
  **Binary Output:** `00000001 00000101`  
  Explanation: Opcode 1 (LOAD) and Operand 5 (immediate value).

- **2 (ADD):** Add immediate value 3 to the contents of R0.  
  **Binary Output:** `00000010 00000011`  
  Explanation: Opcode 2 (ADD) and Operand 3 (immediate value).

- **64 (OUTPUT):** Output the value in R0.  
  **Binary Output:** `01000000 00000000`  
  Explanation: Opcode 64 (OUTPUT) with no operand.

- **240 (HALT):** Stop the program execution.  
  **Binary Output:** `11110000 00000000`  
  Explanation: Opcode 240 (HALT) with no operand.

### *Algorithm:*

- Define opcodes for all supported instructions (LOAD, ADD, OUTPUT, etc.).
- Create an assembler to convert human-readable assembly code to binary instructions.

## *Week 3: Basic CPU Components*

### *Objective:*  
Implement the core components of the CPU.

### *Core Components:*

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Handles arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Registers:** Small memory locations for temporary data storage.
- **Program Counter (PC):** Holds the address of the next instruction.
- **Instruction Register (IR):** Stores the instruction currently being executed.

### *Algorithm:*

- Initialize all registers to zero.
- Create a list of 256 bytes for memory.
- Implement ALU methods for arithmetic operations.

---

## *Week 4: Instruction Execution*

### *Objective:*  
Implement the fetch-decode-execute cycle.

### *Fetch-Decode-Execute Algorithm:*

1. **Fetch:**
   - Retrieve the instruction from memory at the address held by the PC.
   - Increment the PC to point to the next instruction.

2. **Decode:**
   - Extract the opcode and operand from the fetched instruction.

3. **Execute:**
   - Perform the operation using the ALU and registers based on the opcode.
   - Handle any memory access or output as required.

---

## *Week 5: Memory Management*

### *Objective:*  
Set up memory and handle read/write operations.

### *Memory Management Algorithm:*

- Initialize a simulated memory space (e.g., a list of 256 bytes).
- Implement memory read/write functions:
  - **Read:** Retrieve data from a specific memory address.
  - **Write:** Store data at a specific memory address.
- Handle address mapping and memory segmentation for instructions, data, and I/O.

---

## *Week 6: I/O Operations*

### *Objective:*  
Add input/output functionality to the virtual CPU.

### *I/O Algorithm:*

- **Simulated Input:** Store user input in a buffer accessible by the CPU.
- **Simulated Output:** Output the value in a register to a display buffer.

### *I/O Instructions:*

- **INPUT:** Load user input into a register.
- **OUTPUT:** Display the value in a register.

---

## *Week 7: Advanced Features*

### *Objective:*  
Add control flow, subroutines, and interrupts to the virtual CPU.

### *Control Flow Algorithm:*

- **Branching Instructions:**
  - **JUMP:** Change the PC to a new instruction address.
  - **Conditional Branching (e.g., IF ZERO):** Jump only if a condition is met.
- **Subroutines:**
  - Save the return address before jumping to a subroutine.
  - Use a RETURN instruction to restore the saved address.
- **Interrupts:**
  - Allow external events to pause execution and jump to an interrupt handler.

---

## *Week 8: Performance Optimization*

### *Objective:*  
Improve the emulator’s performance.

### *Optimization Algorithm:*

- **Profiling:** Use Python’s built-in profiling tools to identify slow parts of the code.
- **Optimize Critical Paths:** Rewrite slow functions (e.g., ALU operations and memory access) for better efficiency.
- **Assembler Enhancements:** Improve instruction encoding for faster instruction parsing and execution.

---

## *Week 9: Final Testing & Debugging*

### *Objective:*  
Thoroughly test the emulator with different programs and fix any issues.

### *Testing Algorithm:*

- Create multiple test programs that cover all possible instructions and edge cases.
- Run the programs and compare the output to expected results.
- Debug errors and ensure all instructions execute correctly.

---

## *Week 10: Documentation & Presentation*

### *Objective:*  
Prepare documentation and presentation materials for the project.

### *Tasks:*

- **Documentation:**
  - Write comprehensive documentation covering the emulator’s design, instruction set, and usage.
  - Prepare a project report detailing objectives, design decisions, challenges, and solutions.
- **Presentation:**
  - Create presentation slides and a demo to showcase the emulator’s features.
