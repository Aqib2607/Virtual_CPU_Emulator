# Virtual CPU Emulator

## Overview
This project implements a **Virtual CPU Emulator** to simulate essential CPU components and operations. The emulator is designed to cover concepts such as Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), memory management, and I/O operations. The project follows a structured multi-week development plan, allowing incremental progress and feature integration.

## Features
- **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** Supports basic instructions like `ADD`, `SUB`, `LOAD`, and `STORE`.
- **ALU Operations:** Performs arithmetic and logic calculations.
- **Memory Management:** Implements memory read and write functionalities.
- **I/O Operations:** Includes basic input and output mechanisms.
- **Testing Environment:** Supports testing assembly programs within the emulator.

## Development Plan
The project is divided into weekly tasks to ensure gradual and systematic progress:

### Week 1
- Setting up the project environment.
- Writing initial documentation and creating project scaffolding.

### Week 2
- Developing the assembler to translate assembly language instructions into machine code.

### Week 3
- Implementing the register module for storing temporary data during execution.

### Week 4
- Building the fetch mechanism to retrieve instructions from memory.

### Week 5
- Implementing memory management and testing data read/write operations.

### Week 6
- Integrating all components and testing the overall emulator functionality.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler:** Ensure a modern C++ compiler is installed.
- **CMake:** Build and manage the project.
- **Git:** Version control for collaborative development.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aqib2607/Virtual_CPU_Emulator.git
   cd Virtual_CPU_Emulator
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
3. Run the emulator:
   ```bash
   ./Virtual_CPU_Emulator
   ```

### Assembler Usage
To assemble a program:
```bash
./Assembler input.asm output.bin
```
