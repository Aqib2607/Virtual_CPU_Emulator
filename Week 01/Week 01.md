# Week 01: Project Planning & Setup

## 1. Defining the Project Scope

To start, we met as a team to determine the exact scope of our emulator. Our goal is to create a virtual CPU that can mimic the basic operations of a physical CPU. Here's what we defined:

- **Core Operations**: Our emulator will handle essential arithmetic and logic functions, such as ADD, SUBTRACT, and logical comparisons.
- **Memory Management**: We aim to include basic memory handling capabilities, like reading and writing data, to simulate a CPU's interaction with memory.
- **Instruction Set**: We'll build a simple instruction set architecture (ISA), which defines the list of operations (like LOAD, STORE, etc.) the emulator will support.
- **I/O Handling**: We also want our emulator to perform simple input and output operations to simulate basic I/O interactions.

By defining these features early on, we created a roadmap to guide us in later stages. This clarity helps us avoid scope creep and lets us stay focused on completing core components each week.

## 2. Gathering Resources

We researched and gathered materials that explain the foundational concepts of CPU emulation, which includes topics like:

- **CPU Architecture Basics**: Resources on the functioning of a real CPU to understand the components we need to emulate.
- **Instruction Set Architectures (ISA)**: Understanding how different ISAs work to design our own simplified version.
- **Emulator Development Guides**: Studying existing emulators to learn best practices and common pitfalls.

## 3. Setting Up the Development Environment

After defining our scope and gathering resources, we set up our development environment:

- **Programming Language**: We chose Python for its simplicity and readability, which is beneficial for a project focused on understanding concepts.
- **Version Control**: We initialized a Git repository to manage our codebase collaboratively.
- **Development Tools**: Installed necessary tools and libraries that will assist in the development process, such as code editors and debugging tools.

By the end of Week 01, we established a clear project scope, acquired the necessary knowledge resources, and set up our development environment, laying a solid foundation for the weeks to come.
